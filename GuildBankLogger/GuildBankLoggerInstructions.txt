Excel Overview Sheet Setup

Create a new sheet called Overview.

Columns:

Formulas

Total Gold Deposited (example in B2)

=SUMIF(GuildBankLogs!B:B, A2, GuildBankLogs!C:C)


A2 is the player name on the Overview sheet.

Total Gold Withdrawn (example in C2)

=SUMIF(GuildBankLogs!B:B, A2, GuildBankLogs!D:D)


Total Items Deposited (example in D2)

=SUMIF(GuildBankLogs!B:B, A2, GuildBankLogs!F:F)


Total Items Withdrawn (example in E2)

=SUMIF(GuildBankLogs!B:B, A2, GuildBankLogs!G:G)


Contribution Points (example in F2)

= (B2/100*2 + D2*0.25) - (C2/100*2 + E2*0.25)


Handles gold in 100g chunks and items in stacks, giving 2 points per 100g deposited/withdrawn, 0.25 per item.

Status (example in G2)

=IF(F2>0,"Green",IF(F2=0,"Yellow","Red"))


This can be later replaced with conditional formatting for color-coding.

Raids Column (example in H2)

Input manually or pull from a separate sheet logging raids.

Adjusted Points (example in I2)

=F2 - (H2*5)


Subtract 5 points per raid as a penalty or tweak as desired.

Notes

Stack sizes are automatically handled by using the ItemDeposit and ItemWithdraw totals.

Contribution points reflect both gold and items.

Adjust raid penalties based on your guild’s fair system.
